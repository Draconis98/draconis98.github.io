## Projects

### 2024

- **DuDe: Dual Decompose of Weights and Singular Values Adapter** _(05 2024 - 10 2024)_  
  - Proposed a novel method combining weight decomposition and SVD to enhance the fine-tuning of pretrained Large Language Models, effectively reducing the number of parameters required during model fine-tuning, significantly improving efficiency and adaptability in commonsense reasoning tasks.

- **A Teaching Assistant Chatbot for Computer Architecture** _(11 2023 - 03 2024)_
  - Developed a specialized chatbot for the Computer Architecture course at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences for the Spring 2024 semester by text-processing course materials, synthesizing training datasets via the GPT-4 API, and fine-tuning the Baichuan2-7B model with the LoRA method, effectively serving nearly a hundred students.
